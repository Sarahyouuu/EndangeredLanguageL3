Where and How to Access the Code via GitHub
link to the GitHub EndangeredLanguageL3 respiratory: https://github.com/Sarahyouuu/EndangeredLanguageL3

What every file means:
(language name).pdf = the original pdf of the dictionary but without the first few pages and last few pages 
first few pages: contain the watermark, the dictionary name, the compiler and other unimportant information 
last few pages: contain a list of all the words in the dictionary, which is also unimportant 
(language name)_stripped_final.txt = the final transcribed text without the added sentences (see above comment for the sentences to be added) 
(language name)_stripped.txt = the text version of the pdf dictionary 
this text file only removed pictures and watermarks and stars next to the words 
this is the file that I compare to with (language name)_stripped_final.txt 

**NOTE**
for Saaroa, you would compare Saaroa_Stripped_1.txt with Saaroa_Stripped_final_1.txt!
